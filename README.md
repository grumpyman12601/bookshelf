# Bookshelf Beta 0.6.0
This is an extension made to hide the shelf on ChromeOS devices. It should work on all versions that support desk hiding when a page is displayed on screen.
This is the 6th itteration, of my project, and all other versions didn't work at all or didn't have permissions, or were too much of a hassle for the average person to set up/maintain.

## What you need
- The ability to install unpacked extensions
- Possibly debug skill, read #[Issues](https://github.com/grumpyman12601/bookshelf#issues) for help if the extension doesn't work for you.
- A Chromebook running at least v115 for float mode (optional but VERY important so the page doesn't stop displaying)
- All 46 ChromeOSomes

# Installation
1. Download this repository
2. Enable dev mode on chrome://extensions
3. Click on the "Load Unpacked" icon
4. Select the root file directory for the extension, and click open

# Usage
1. Click on the extension
2. Click "Start"
3. Hold your mouse over the enlarge tab button until a dropdown menu comes up, select float, and move the icon to the corner of your screen.


If you run into issues, open an issue report, and I can hopefully help.

### Issues
This is still in development, and I don't have any erorrs ouside of the project just not working YET


### Testing and patching
I am very unfamiliar with coding in HTML, JS, or CSS because all of my current experience is in shell scripting.

Any help/patches would help because even I can admit this extension sucks.

## ISSUE (S) FOR DEVELOPER (S)
### Error #1
The tab still shows up, but there is no way to fix this, unless I add a move button that moves it offscreen more to avoid latching to the half-page display option. This will not fix the problem but just make it less apparent. As far as I know unless you use firefox it's impossible to completely hide a tab.
