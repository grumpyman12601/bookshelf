# bookshelf
An extension that hides your taskbar, useful while running Livepaper to get a cleaner desktop.
# Prerequisites
- Linux support
- Firefox 
- Ability to install extensions on Firefox
- No will to live
## The methods behind the madness
This is my first coding project, so it will be buggy, I just wanted a challenging project, and I got it.

### The reason you need Firefox
tabs.hide()
This is a line of code that is only available on Firefox. I need it to completely hide the page.html from your view. I'm not sure if this will work as it's still in development.

# Issues
HTML bugs
Testing for Firefox has to be done using a special .xpi extension file, you can't upload unpacked extension files like you can with Chrome.

## Testing and Patching
I am very unfamiliar with coding in HTML, JS, or CSS because before I was doing shell scripting.
Any help/patches would help because even I can admit this extension sucks.
