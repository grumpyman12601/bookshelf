# Bookshelf Beta 0.6.0
This is bookshelf v6, it's a simple design with minimal installation, just use it like a regular extension.

### What you need
- The ability to install unpacked extensions
- Possibly debug skill, read # Issues for help if the extension doesn't work for you.
- A Chromebook
- All 46 ChromeOSomes

## Installation
1. Download this repository
2. Enable dev mode on chrome://extensions
3. Click on the "Load Unpacked" icon
4. Select the root file directory for the extension, and click open

## Usage
1. Click on the extension
2. Click "Open"
If you run into issues, open an issue report, and I can hopefully help.

### Issues
This is still in development, and I don't have any erorrs ouside of the project just not working


## Testing and patching
I am very unfamiliar with coding in HTML, JS, or CSS because all of my current experience is in shell scripting.

Any help/patches would help because even I can admit this extension sucks.
