# THIS EXTENSION DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK ON CHROME OS DEVICES. AT ALL.
I just wanted it public because I'm looking at an internship and I want them to review my projects.

# Bookshelf Beta 0.6.0
This is an extension made to hide the shelf on ChromeOS devices. It should work on all versions that support desk hiding when a page is displayed on screen.
This is the 6th itteration, of my project, and all other versions didn't work at all or didn't have permissions, or were too much of a hassle for the average person to set up/maintain.

## What you need
- The ability to install unpacked extensions
- Possibly debug skill, read #[Issues](https://github.com/grumpyman12601/bookshelf#issues) for help if the extension doesn't work for you.
- A Chromebook
- All 46 ChromeOSomes

# Installation
1. Download this repository
2. Enable dev mode on chrome://extensions
3. Click on the "Load Unpacked" icon
4. Select the root file directory for the extension, and click open

# Usage
1. Click on the extension
2. Click "Open"
If you run into issues, open an issue report, and I can hopefully help.

### Issues
This is still in development, and I don't have any erorrs ouside of the project just not working YET


### Testing and patching
I am very unfamiliar with coding in HTML, JS, or CSS because all of my current experience is in shell scripting.

Any help/patches would help because even I can admit this extension sucks.
